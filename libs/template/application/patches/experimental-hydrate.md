# Lit Experimental Hydrate Patch

This patch fixes two bugs:

- [Hydrating elements](https://spryker.atlassian.net/browse/FAAS-2863) rendered through asyncDirective classes

* Affects: lit-html
* Version: 2.2.7

## Files

- experimental-hydrate.patch - for patching experimental-hydrate.js in development mode
- experimental-hydrate.js - replaces the file in default mode

## Updating

- Lit builds the library with two modes: development and default (prod). The patch file fixes the development files but the default build is minified and not suitable for patching, so it's been generated by applying the changes in the lit repo itself, re-building and then using the built files to replace the original file in default mode.

- The patch fixes [these lines](https://github.com/lit/lit/blob/main/packages/lit-html/src/experimental-hydrate.ts#L342-L343). The last element in the stack may not necessarily be of type `template-instance` in the case of rendering with `asyncDirective`, so the patch checks for the next `template-instance` state while searching backwards for it.
