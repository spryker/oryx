# Oryx Presets package

Provides presets to Oryx applications. Presets are opinionated quick starters that avoids having a lot of boilerplate. Presets contain predefined feature sets.

Presets are typically used to demonstrate or try out Oryx applications in a fast manner. Product applications will most likely setup the boilerplate in more optimised way, by leaving out features that are not used.

The presets are likely not the perfect production setup for your project, as it comes with a full feature set. In a production setup, you might want to skip some features that included in the preset.

## Installation

`npm install @spryker-oryx/presets`
