   * designer therefore might ignore the formal structural elements and style the headings depending
   * on the layout.
   *
   * To overcome this problem, the component allows to _mimic_ a certain style for a semantic element.
   *

   * <oryx-heading as="h3">
   *   <h1>Heading text</h1>

   * the heading on certain screens only.
